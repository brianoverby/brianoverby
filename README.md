# Hello there

This is my little jar of code scribbles. Most of it is related to keyboards - well, [Planck Keyboards](https://olkb.com/)
You can find my repository with my Planck Keyboard code - It's a Nordic/Danish layout but with US keycap legends.

I also host my website on Github - but that's more of a playground, so nothing special.
